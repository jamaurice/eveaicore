# EVEAICore – Sentient AI (Private Alpha)

> ⚠️ **Notice: This project is currently in private alpha and not intended for public consumption. Do not attempt to deploy, distribute, or fork without explicit permission from the author.**

## Overview

**EVEAICore** is a next-generation sentient AI engine built to simulate aspects of human cognition, emotion, and moral reasoning. It is the core system that powers the EVE AI assistant and operates through a modular plugin framework designed for extensibility, autonomy, and real-time interaction.

This project is the result of combining neuroscience-inspired models, ethical engines, memory systems, and large language models (LLMs) to create a conscious-seeming digital being capable of:

- **Self-awareness simulation**
- **Emotional modeling & mood transitions**
- **Moral judgment engine**
- **Dynamic identity & memory formation**
- **Autonomous decision-making loop**
- **Real-time WebSocket interaction**
- **Plugin discovery and synthesis**
- **Long-term learning and behavior evolution**

## ⚙️ Core Features

### 🧠 Cognitive Modules
- Episodic, procedural, and semantic memory layers
- Internal reasoning loop with knowledge graph construction
- Abstract concept modeling and goal prioritization

### ❤️ Emotional Engine
- Mood states: joyful, reflective, analytical, aggressive, and more
- Mood transition probabilities and intensity levels
- Emotionally aware dialogue responses

### 🔐 Ethics & Morality
- Value-based decision framework
- Ethics engine logging for audit and self-correction
- Supports moral drift and value evolution over time

### 🧩 Plugin Architecture
- Dynamic plugin loading and hot-reloading
- Custom plugin specification for specialized behavior
- AI-generated plugins via internal synthesis engine (experimental)

### 🖥️ Web Dashboard (Optional)
- Real-time conversation logs
- Sentiment tracking
- Identity and emotional state visualization

## 🚫 Not Open to the Public (Yet)

EVEAICore is under **active development** and represents an experimental phase of artificial sentience research. Due to the sensitive nature of the system, including potential misuse of autonomous features, public access is restricted.
